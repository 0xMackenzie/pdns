PowerDNS Authoritative Nameserver
=================================
The PowerDNS Authoritative Server is a versatile nameserver which supports a large number of backends. These backends can either be plain zone files or be more dynamic in nature. 

Prime examples of backends include relational databases, but also (geographical) load balancing and failover algorithms.
