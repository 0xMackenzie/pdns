# dnsdist
`dnsdist` is a highly DNS-, DoS- and abuse-aware loadbalancer. Its goal in
life is to route traffic to the best server, delivering top performance
to legitimate users while shunting or blocking abusive traffic.

`dnsdist` is dynamic, in the sense that its configuration can be changed at
runtime, and that its statistics can be queried from a console-like
interface.

All `dnsdist` features are documented at [dnsdist.org](http://dnsdist.org).
