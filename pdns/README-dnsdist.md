dnsdist
-------
`dnsdist` is a highly DNS-, DoS- and abuse-aware loadbalancer. Its goal in
life is to route traffic to the best server, delivering top performance
to legitimate users while shunting or blocking abusive traffic.

`dnsdist` is dynamic, in the sense that its configuration can be changed at
runtime, and that its statistics can be queried from a console-like
interface.

WARNING: `dnsdist` is still under HEAVY development, but we are giving it some
publicity in hopes of getting constructive feedback that will help us guide
our feature set.

Do NOT take this into production, but please DO let us know your thoughts!
Test packages can be found on http://xs.powerdns.com/dnsdist/

Here is a minimal configuration:

```
$ cat /etc/dnsdist.conf
newServer2 {address="2001:4860:4860::8888", qps=1}
newServer2 {address="2001:4860:4860::8844", qps=1} 
newServer2 {address="2620:0:ccc::2", qps=10}
newServer2 {address="2620:0:ccd::2", qps=10}
newServer("192.168.1.2")

$ dnsdist --local=0.0.0.0:5200 --daemon=no
Marking downstream [2001:4860:4860::8888]:53 as 'up'
Marking downstream [2001:4860:4860::8844]:53 as 'up'
Marking downstream [2620:0:ccc::2]:53 as 'up'
Marking downstream [2620:0:ccd::2]:53 as 'up'
Marking downstream 192.168.1.2:53 as 'up'
Listening on 0.0.0.0:5200
>
```

We can now send queries to port 5200, and get answers:

```
$ dig -t aaaa powerdns.com @127.0.0.1 -p 5200 +short
2001:888:2000:1d::2
```

Note that dnsdist offered us a prompt above, and on it we can get some
statistics:

```
> listServers()
#   Address                   State     Qps    Qlim    Queries   Drops Drate    Lat
0   [2001:4860:4860::8888]:53    up     0.0       1          1       0 0.0      0.1
1   [2001:4860:4860::8844]:53    up     0.0       1          0       0 0.0      0.0
2   [2620:0:ccc::2]:53           up     0.0      10          0       0 0.0      0.0
3   [2620:0:ccd::2]:53           up     0.0      10          0       0 0.0      0.0
4   192.168.1.2:53               up     0.0       0          0       0 0.0      0.0
All                                     0.0                  1       0             
```

Here we also see our configuration. 5 downstream servers have been configured, of
which the first 4 have a QPS limit (of 1, 1, 10 and 10 queries per second,
respectively). The final server has no limit, which we can easily test:

```
$ for a in {0..1000}; do dig powerdns.com @127.0.0.1 -p 5200 +noall > /dev/null; done
> listServers()
#   Address                   State     Qps    Qlim    Queries   Drops Drate    Lat
0   [2001:4860:4860::8888]:53    up     1.0       1          7       0 0.0      1.6
1   [2001:4860:4860::8844]:53    up     1.0       1          6       0 0.0      0.6
2   [2620:0:ccc::2]:53           up    10.3      10         64       0 0.0      2.4
3   [2620:0:ccd::2]:53           up    10.3      10         63       0 0.0      2.4
4   192.168.1.2:53               up   125.8       0        671       0 0.0      0.4
All                                   145.0                811       0             
```

Note that the first 4 servers were all limited to near their configured QPS,
and that our final server was taking up most of the traffic. No queries were
dropped, and all servers remain up.

To force a server down, try:

```
> getServer(0):setDown()
> listServers()
#   Address                   State     Qps    Qlim    Queries   Drops Drate    Lat
0   [2001:4860:4860::8888]:53  DOWN     0.0       1          8       0 0.0      1.7
...
```

The 'DOWN' in all caps means it was forced down. A lower case 'down'
would've meant that dnsdist itself had concluded the server was down.
Similarly, setUp() forces a server to be up, and setAuto() returns it to the
default availability-probing.

To change the QPS for a server:
```
> getServer(0):setQPS(1000)
```

Now for some cool stuff. Let's say we know we're getting a whole bunch of
traffic for a domain used in DoS attacks, for example 'sh43354.cn'. We can
do two things with this kind of traffic. Either we block it outright, like
this:

```
> addDomainBlock("sh43354.cn.")
```

Or we configure a server dedicated to receiving the nasty stuff:

```
> abuseServer(newServer("192.168.1.3"))
> abuseSMN("sh43353.cn.")
```

The wonderful thing about this last solution is that it can also be used for
things where a domain might possibly be legit, but it is still causing load
on the system and slowing down the internet for everyone. With such an abuse
server, 'bad traffic' still gets a chance of an answer, but without
impacting the rest of the world (too much).

We can similarly add clients to the abuse server:

```
> abuseNM("192.168.12.0/24")
> abuseNM("192.168.13.14")
```

More power
----------
More powerful things can be achieved by defining a function called
`blockFilter()` in the configuration file, which can decide to drop traffic
on any reason it wants. If you return 'true' from there, the query will get
blocked.

A demo on how to do this and many other things can be found on
https://github.com/ahupowerdns/pdns/blob/dnsname/pdns/dnsdistconf.lua

ANY or whatever to TC
---------------------
The `blockFilter()` also gets passed read/writable copy of the DNS Header.
If you invoke setQR(1) on that, dnsdist knows you turned the packet into
a response, and will send the answer directly to the original client.

If you also called setTC(1), this will tell the remote client to move to
TCP/IP, and in this way you can implement ANY-to-TCP even for downstream
servers that lack this feature.

Dynamic load balancing
----------------------

The default load balancing policy is called 'firstAvailable', which means
the first server that has not exceeded its QPS limit gets the traffic.  If
you don't like this default policy, you can create your own, like this for
example:

```
counter=0
servers=getServers()
function luaroundrobin(remote, qname, qtype, dh) 
	 counter=counter+1
	 return servers[1+(counter % #servers)]
end

setServerPolicy(luaroundrobin)
```

Incidentally, this is similar to setting: `setServerPolicy(roundrobin)`
which uses the C++ based roundrobin policy.

To implement a split horizon, try:

```
authServer=newServer2{address="2001:888:2000:1d::2", order=12}
-- order=12 is the current hack to make sure this server does 
-- generally get used, will be replaced by dedicated pools later

function splitSetup(remote, qname, qtype, dh)
	 if(dh:getRD() == false)
	 then
		return authServer
	 else
		return firstAvailable(remote, qname, qtype, dh)
	 end
end
```

This will forward queries that don't want recursion to a specific
server, and will apply the default load balancing policy to all
other queries.

Running it for real
-------------------
First run on the command line, and generate a key:

```
# dnsdist --daemon-no
> makeKey()
setKey("sepuCcHcQnSAZgNbNPCCpDWbujZ5esZJmrt/wh6ldkQ=")
```
Now add this setKey line to `dnsdistconf.lua`, and also add:

```
controlSocket("0.0.0.0") -- or add portnumber too
```

Then start `dnsdist` as a daemon, and then connect to it:
```
# dnsdist
# dnsdist --client
> 
```

ACL, who can use dnsdist
------------------------
For safety reasons, by default only private networks can use dnsdist, see below
how to query and change the ACL:

```
> showACL()
127.0.0.0/8
10.0.0.0/8
(...)
::1/128
fc00::/7
fe80::/10
> addACL("130.161.0.0/16")
> setACL({"::/0"}) -- resets the list to this array
> showACL()
::/0
```
