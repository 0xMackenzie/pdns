ixfrdist
========

Synopsis
--------

:program:`ixfrdist` [*OPTION*]... *DOMAIN* [*DOMAIN*]...

Description
-----------

:program:`ixfrdist` transfers zones from an authoritative server and re-serves these zones over AXFR and IXFR.
It checks the SOA serial for all *DOMAIN*\ s from the server set with **--server-address** and downloads new versions to **--work-dir**.
This working directory has the following structure: ``work-dir/ZONE/SERIAL``, e.g. ``work-dir/rpz.example./2018011902``.

When a SOA query comes in on the address(es) set with **--listen-address**, :program:`ixfrdist` responds with the latest SOA for the zone it has.
This query can be followed up with an IXFR or AXFR query, which will then be served.
Should an IXFR be served, :program:`ixfrdist` will condense the diff into the IXFR.
