# Basic setup: configuring database connectivity
This shows you how to configure the Generic MySQL backend. This backend
is called 'gmysql', and needs to be configured in `pdns.conf`.  Add the
following lines, adjusted for your local setup (specifically, you may not
want to use the 'root' user):

```
launch=gmysql
gmysql-host=127.0.0.1
gmysql-user=root
gmysql-dbname=pdns
gmysql-password=mysecretpassword
```

Remove any earlier [`launch`](settings.md#launch) statements and other configuration
statements for backends.

**Warning**: Make sure that you can actually resolve the hostname of your database without accessing the database! It is advised to supply an IP address here to prevent chicken/egg problems!

Now start PowerDNS using the monitor command:

```
# service pdns monitor
(...)
Dec 30 13:40:09 About to create 3 backend threads for UDP
Dec 30 13:40:09 gmysql Connection failed: Unable to connect to database: Access denied for user 'hubert'@'localhost' to database 'pdns-non-existant'
Dec 30 13:40:09 Caught an exception instantiating a backend: Unable to launch gmysql connection: Unable to connect to database: Access denied for user 'hubert'@'localhost' to database 'pdns-non-existant'
Dec 30 13:40:09 Cleaning up
Dec 30 13:40:10 Done launching threads, ready to distribute questions
```

This is as to be expected - we did not yet add anything to MySQL for PDNS to read from. At this point you may also see other errors which indicate that PDNS either could not find your MySQL server or was unable to connect to it. Fix these before proceeding.

General MySQL knowledge is assumed in this chapter, please do not interpret these commands as DBA advice!

##Â Example: configuring MySQL
Connect to MySQL as a user with sufficient privileges and issue the following commands:

``` 
!!include=../modules/gmysqlbackend/schema.mysql.sql
```

Now we have a database and an empty table. PDNS should now be able to launch in monitor mode and display no errors:

```
# /etc/init.d/pdns monitor
(...)
15:31:30 PowerDNS 1.99.0 (Mar 12 2002, 15:00:28) starting up
15:31:30 About to create 3 backend threads
15:39:55 [gMySQLbackend] MySQL connection succeeded
15:39:55 [gMySQLbackend] MySQL connection succeeded
15:39:55 [gMySQLbackend] MySQL connection succeeded
```

In a different shell, a sample query sent to the server should now return quickly without data:

```
$ dig +short www.example.com @127.0.0.1
$
```

**Warning**: When debugging DNS problems, don't use `host`. Please use `dig`  or `drill`.

And indeed, the control console now shows:

```
Mar 12 15:41:12 We're not authoritative for 'www.example.com', sending unauth normal response
```

Now we need to add some records to our database (in a separate shell):

```
# mysql pdnstest
mysql> INSERT INTO domains (name, type) values ('example.com', 'NATIVE');
INSERT INTO records (domain_id, name, content, type,ttl,prio)
VALUES (1,'example.com','localhost ahu@ds9a.nl 1','SOA',86400,NULL);
INSERT INTO records (domain_id, name, content, type,ttl,prio)
VALUES (1,'example.com','dns-us1.powerdns.net','NS',86400,NULL);
INSERT INTO records (domain_id, name, content, type,ttl,prio)
VALUES (1,'example.com','dns-eu1.powerdns.net','NS',86400,NULL);
INSERT INTO records (domain_id, name, content, type,ttl,prio)
VALUES (1,'www.example.com','192.0.2.10','A',120,NULL);
INSERT INTO records (domain_id, name, content, type,ttl,prio)
VALUES (1,'mail.example.com','192.0.2.12','A',120,NULL);
INSERT INTO records (domain_id, name, content, type,ttl,prio)
VALUES (1,'localhost.example.com','127.0.0.1','A',120,NULL);
INSERT INTO records (domain_id, name, content, type,ttl,prio)
VALUES (1,'example.com','mail.example.com','MX',120,25);
```

**Warning**: Host names and the MNAME of a [SOA](../types.md#soa) records are NEVER terminated with a '.' in PowerDNS storage! If a trailing '.' is present it will inevitably cause problems, problems that may be hard to debug.

If we now requery our database, `www.example.com` should be present:

```
$ dig +short www.example.com @127.0.0.1
192.0.2.10

$ dig +short example.com MX @127.0.0.1
25 mail.example.com
```

To confirm what happened, issue the command [`SHOW *`](internals.md#show-variable) to the control console:

```
% show *
corrupt-packets=0,latency=0,packetcache-hit=2,packetcache-miss=5,packetcache-size=0,
qsize-a=0,qsize-q=0,servfail-packets=0,tcp-answers=0,tcp-queries=0,
timedout-packets=0,udp-answers=7,udp-queries=7,
%
```

The actual numbers will vary somewhat. Now enter `QUIT` and start PDNS as a regular daemon, and check launch status:

```
# /etc/init.d/pdns start
pdns: started
# /etc/init.d/pdns status
pdns: 8239: Child running
# /etc/init.d/pdns dump
pdns: corrupt-packets=0,latency=0,packetcache-hit=0,packetcache-miss=0,
packetcache-size=0,qsize-a=0,qsize-q=0,servfail-packets=0,tcp-answers=0,
tcp-queries=0,timedout-packets=0,udp-answers=0,udp-queries=0,
```

You now have a working database driven nameserver! To convert other zones already present, use the [`zone2sql`](migration.md#zone2sql) tool.

## Common problems
Most problems involve PDNS not being able to connect to the database.

### Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2)
Your MySQL installation is probably defaulting to another location for its socket. Can be resolved by figuring out this location (often `/var/run/mysqld.sock`), and specifying it in the configuration file with the [`gmysql-socket`](backend-generic-mysql.md#gmysql-socket) parameter.

Another solution is to not connect to the socket, but to 127.0.0.1, which can be achieved by specifying [`gmysql-host=127.0.0.1`](backend-generic-mysql.md#gmysql-host).

### Host 'x.y.z.w' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
These errors are generic MySQL errors. Solve them by trying to connect to your MySQL database with the MySQL console utility `mysql` with the parameters specified to PDNS. Consult the MySQL documentation.

## Typical Errors after Installing
At this point some things may have gone wrong. Typical errors include:

### binding to UDP socket: Address already in use
This means that another nameserver is listening on port 53 already. You can resolve this problem by determining if it is safe to shutdown the nameserver already present, and doing so. If uncertain, it is also possible to run PDNS on another port. To do so, add [`local-port=5300`](settings.md#local-port) to `pdns.conf`, and try again. This however implies that you can only test your nameserver as clients expect the nameserver to live on port 53.

### binding to UDP socket: Permission denied
You must be superuser in order to be able to bind to port 53. If this is not a possibility, it is also possible to run PDNS on another port. To do so, add [`local-port=5300`](settings.md#local-port) to `pdns.conf`, and try again. This however implies that you can only test your nameserver as clients expect the nameserver to live on port 53.

### Unable to launch, no backends configured for querying
PDNS did not find the `launch=bind` instruction in pdns.conf.

### Multiple IP addresses on your server, PDNS sending out answers on the wrong one, Massive amounts of 'recvfrom gave error, ignoring: Connection refused'
If you have multiple IP addresses on the internet on one machine, UNIX often sends out answers over another interface than which the packet came in on. In such cases, use [`local-address`](settings.md#local-address) to bind to specific IP addresses, which can be comma separated. The second error comes from remotes disregarding answers to questions it didn't ask to that IP address and sending back ICMP errors.

# Using ALIAS records
The ALIAS record provides a way to have CNAME-like behaviour on the zone apex.

In order to correctly serve ALIAS records, set the [`recursor`](settings.md#recursor)
setting to an existing resolver and add the ALIAS record to your zone apex. e.g.:

```
recursor=[::1]:5300
```

```
$ORIGIN example.net
$TTL 1800

@ IN SOA ns1.example.net. hostmaster.example.net. 2015121101 1H 15 1W 2H

@ IN NS ns1.example.net.

@ IN ALIAS mywebapp.paas-provider.net.
```

When the authoritative server receives a query for the A-record for `example.net`,
it will resolve the A record for `mywebapp.paas-provider.net` and serve an answer
for `example.net` with that A record.

# CDS & CDNSKEY Key Rollover
If the upstream registry supports [RFC 7344](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7344)
key rollovers you can use several [`pdnsutil`](dnssec.md#pdnsutil) commands to do
this rollover. This HowTo follows the rollover example from the RFCs [Appendix B](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7344#appendix-B).

We assume the zone name is example.com and is already DNSSEC signed.

Start by adding a new KSK to the zone: `pdnsutil add-zone-key example.com ksk 2048 inactive`.
The "inactive" means that the key is not used to sign any ZSK records. This limits
the size of `ANY` and DNSKEY responses.

Publish the CDS records: `pdnsutil set-publish-cds example.com`, these records
will tell the parent zone to update its DS records. Now wait for the DS records
to be updated in the parent zone.

Once the DS records are updated, do the actual key-rollover: `pdnsutil activate-zone-key example.com new-key-id`
and `pdnsutil deactivate-zone-key example.com old-key-id`. You can get the `new-key-id`
and `old-key-id` by listing them through `pdnsutil show-zone example.com`.

After the rollover, wait *at least* until the TTL on the DNSKEY records have
expired so validating resolvers won't mark the zone as BOGUS. When the wait is
over, delete the old key from the zone: `pdnsutil remove-zone-key example.com old-key-id`.
This updates the CDS records to reflect only the new key.

Wait for the parent to pick up on the CDS change. Once the upstream DS records
show only the DS records for the new KSK, you may disable sending out the CDS
responses: `pdnsutil unset-pushish-cds example.com`.

Done!
